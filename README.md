# The Exoplanet Project

The Exoplanet Project, named Other Words, is a simple app that represents a quick guide to exoplanets - planets outside our solar system.

## UX

### Project Goals

The app is designed as a simple to use guide to exoplanets. The main goal is to provide the user the possibiliy to have her/his own list where she/he can add their prefered exoplanets in order to keep track of them as they are confirmed, and also to add any exoplanets that have been confirmed so far. To kick things off, a list with 12 of the most relevant exoplanets confirmed up date will be provided. From there, the user is free to add any of the planets to her/his list. To make things a bit more interesting, the user will also have the possibility to check her/his weight on any of the exoplanets added, if ever, hypothetically, will have the chance to end up on one of them :)

### User Goals

* An app that serves as a guide to relevant confirmed exolanets.
* Possibility to add any new prefered exoplanet to her/his own list.
* Possibility to delete any new prefered exoplanet to her/his own list.
* Possibility to see the planets arranged depending on different properties (eg. type, size).
* Navbar availabe across and throughout all sections for a quick and easy navigation on the website.
* A way to follow the developer on social media for the latest updated.
* Responsive interaction with the website on desktop, table and mobile.

### User Stories

* As a user, I would like to be able to find out what's the app about and how to use its features.
* As a user, I would like to have a clear and clean display of the items (exoplanets).
* As a user, I would like a navbar that it's always available on all section, for me to easily navigate at any point at the app from eveywhere.
* As a user, I would like clear action buttons on every section.
* As a user, I would like my own section (list) where I am able to store my items (exoplanets).
* As a user, I would like to possibility to remove at any point any item I wish from my list.
* As a user, I would like a flexible app that would allow me to add any item that I want to my list.
* As a user, I would like an intuitive and easy to complete section to add my items.
* As a user, I am expecting guidance where necessary, especially working with exoplanets and precise data about them, that might require some research on interenet on where it can be found.
* As a user, I would likt to be able to sort my items depending on some of its most important properties.
* As a user, I am looking for an app that will also keep me on some level entertained while I'm using it.

### App Owners Goals

* Providing a dynamic app to act as a guide to exoplanets, where the user would be able to have its own section where she\he can add any exoplanet they wish, thus being a good tool to keep track of all the newly discovered exoplanets.
* Providing the user a default list of exoplanets to get things started and act as a guide on what type of data can be stored about the exoplanets.
* Keeping the user entertained by allowing her/him to calculate its weight on each exoplanet from her/his list. This will encourage the user to insert more items in her/his list, thus the time spent on the app will increase.

## Design Choices

The theme of the app being celestial bodies, I've chosen a somewhat dark tone for the background and a simple design, letting the user focus more on the functionality of the app.

### Fonts: 

I chose to use [KUFAM](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kufam?query=kufam) as main font as I believe it provides a readability. In the same time, having some curvy lines, can be warm and friendly for the user.

I chose [ROBOTO SLAB](https://fonts.google.com/?query=roboto+slab) for all the action buttons as I believe it provides one of the best readability (which is always important for action buttons) and in the same time it can give the app a more futuristic aspect.

### Colors: 

I chose a dark, but in the same time lively theme for the project, as I believe it's it offers the user more focus on the exoplanets.

* Primary: **Indigo**  #1e2761. As working with celestial bodies, I believe this color is somewhat similar to the color of the night sky and also provides a good contrast between the background and the planet's images which are mosttly dark.

* Secondary: **Light Blue** #408ec6. I chose this color as I believe it's related to the primary color and in the same time offering a good enough contrast between them and also between the text, which is a light grey.

* Tertiary: **Maroon** #7a2048. I chose this color for the action buttons as I believe it gives a very good contrast between them and the rest of the app and also makes them more visible. I chose this color as a background when displaying varies messages in the app as I believe it makes more readable, offering a very good contrast with the color of the text - light grey.

* Text Color: **Light Grey** #e5e5dc. I chose this color for the text as overall it gives a good contrast with all backgrounds used in the app.
