# The Exoplanet Project

The Exoplanet Project, named Other Words, is a simple app that represents a quick guide to exoplanets - planets outside our solar system.

## UX

### Project Goals

The app is designed as a simple to use guide to exoplanets. The main goal is to provide the user the possibiliy to have her/his own list where she/he can add their prefered exoplanets in order to keep track of them as they are officially confirmed by NASA, ESA, .. and many others authorized entities, and also to add any of these exoplanets to their favourites list. To kick things off, a list with 12 of the most relevant exoplanets confirmed up date will be provided. From there, the user is free to add any of the planets to her/his list. To make things a bit more interesting, the user will also have the possibility to check her/his weight on any of the exoplanets added, if ever, hypothetically (or not), will have the chance to end up on one of them.

### User Goals

* An app that serves as a guide to relevant confirmed exolanets.
* Possibility to add any new prefered exoplanet to her/his own list.
* Possibility to delete any new prefered exoplanet from her/his own list.
* Possibility to have the planets displayed in the list depending on some of their different properties (eg. type, size).
* Navbar available across and throughout all sections for a quick and easy navigation on the website.
* A way to follow the developer on social media for the latest updated.
* Responsive interaction with the website on desktop, table and mobile.

### User Stories

* As a user, I would like to be able to find out what's the app about and how to use its features.
* As a user, I would like to have a clear and clean display of the items (exoplanets).
* As a user, I would like a navbar that it's always available on all section, for me to easily navigate at any section of the app from everywhere.
* As a user, I would like clean and visible action buttons at every section.
* As a user, I would like my own section (list) where I am able to store my items (exoplanets).
* As a user, I would like the possibility to remove at any point any item I wish from my list.
* As a user, I would like an intuitive and easy way to add items to my list.
* As a user, I am expecting guidance where necessary; especially working with exoplanets and precise data about them, that might require some research on where the specific data can be found.
* As a user, I would like to be notified (via clear messages displayed on the screen) when some specific action cannot be performed and the reasons why.
* As a user, I would like to be able to sort my items depending on some of its most important properties.
* As a user, I am looking for an app that will also keep me on some level entertained while I'm using it.

### App Owners Goals

* Providing a dynamic app to act as a guide to exoplanets, where the user would be able to have its own section where she\he can add any exoplanet they wish, thus being a good tool to keep track of all the newly discovered exoplanets.
* Providing the user a default list of exoplanets to get things started and act as a guide on what type of data can be stored about the exoplanets.
* Keeping the user entertained by allowing her/him to calculate its weight on each exoplanet from her/his list. This will encourage the user to insert more items in her/his list, thus the time spent on the app will increase.

## Design Choices

I have chosen dynamic fonts for the entire app, to keep the user entertained; also they might remind the user of the colors of space dust on some of the best known nebulae.

### Main Image: 

The main image of the app is a representation of the recently confirmed exoplanet **Trappist 1 e** and it has been designed by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) within their [SPACE TOURISM](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/682/space-tourism-posters/) program. Please see at the [Credits](#credits) section the source where the image in the app was taken from. I have chosen this image because it represents the travelers' excitement upon arrival on a foreign planet, with them browsing through the window of their space ship. In my opinion, this can as well represent the users' excitement when browsing through exoplanets in the app. 

### Fonts:

I chose to use [ABRIL FATFACE](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface?query=abril) as the font for all the main titles as I believe it's thickness and clean shape provide good readability and would be a good match for all of the app's sections.

I chose to use [LATO](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) as main font as I believe it provides a good readability and looks proffessional.

I chose to use [ROBOTO SLAB](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=roboto) for all action buttons as I believe it provides one of the best readability (which is always important for action buttons) and in the same time it can give the app a more futuristic aspect.

### Colors: 

* Primary: **See Through Red** rgba(112, 16, 3, 0.8). I chose this color as background for all sections that contain text (including flash messages), as I believe it offers a not so strong contrast with the main image (in this case the main image will still be visible), but in the same time a good enough contrast for the text to be readable. 

* Secondary **Indigo** rgb(60, 10, 125). I chose this color for the action buttons and navbar as it matches some of the colors found in the main background image, and also I believe it provides a very good contrast between them and the rest of the app making them more visible, which is very important in order to provide a good user experience. 

* Tertiary Color: **Light Grey** #e5e5dc. I chose this color for the text as overall it gives a good contrast with all backgrounds used in the app. I chose this in the detriment of plain white as I believe it is also a bit warmer color, being a better fit for the overall design choices used throughout the app.

* Register Button: **Candy Apple Red** rgb(196, 23, 0). I chose this color for the Register button as it stands out on the navbar, urging the user to register if she/he hasn't done it as yet. Also it is similar to the overall colors in the main background image. This color is not used anywhere else in the app.
