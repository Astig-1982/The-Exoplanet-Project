# The Exoplanet Project

The Exoplanet Project, named Other Words, is a simple app that represents a quick guide to exoplanets - planets outside our solar system.

## UX

### Project Goals

The app is designed as a simple to use guide to exoplanets. The main goal is to provide the user the possibiliy to have her/his own list where she/he can add their prefered exoplanets in order to keep track of them as they are confirmed, and also to add any exoplanets that have been confirmed so far. To kick things off, a list with 12 of the most relevant exoplanets confirmed up date will be provided. From there, the user is free to add any of the planets to her/his list. To make things a bit more interesting, the user will also have the possibility to check her/his weight on any of the exoplanets added, if ever, hypothetically, will have the chance to end up on one of them :)

### User Goals

* An app that serves as a guide to relevant confirmed exolanets.
