					Welcome to OTHER WORLDS - a site that offers you a biref guide to some of the most relevant
					exoplanets discovered up to date. You will have your own list of favourite exoplanets
					in which you can add any of the planets from our main list. If you can't find in our main list an
					exoplanet that you would like to add to your Favourites List, not a problem. You can add any
					exoplanet
					that you prefer to your Favourites List by simply entering its details into the form provided.</p>
				<p>Contrary to what's depicting in most SCI FI movies, a fun fact about going to other planets is that
					your weight difers from that of on Earth due to their different gravity attraction. This site also
					gives you the opportunity to quickly find out your weight on each of your favourite exoplanet.
                    Enjoy your trip to other worlds!</p>
